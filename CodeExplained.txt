Stock price prediction project in Python using the pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries
Linear regression model to predict stock prices
Steps:
Data Collection
Data Preprocessing
Splitting Data
Model Selection and Training
Model Evaluation
Model Testing
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) provides a measure of the model's accuracy.

yfinance is used to download historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
train_test_split is used to split the data into training and testing sets.
LinearRegression is an algorithm from scikit-learn used for linear regression modeling.
mean_squared_error is used to calculate the Mean Squared Error, a measure of the model's performance.

stock symbol "AAPL" for Apple Inc. store it in the DataFrame:data 
select the "Close" column of the DataFrame to focus on the closing stock prices
new column "Next_Close" by shifting the "Close" column one day forward to represent the next day's closing price therfore the last day will have NaN in nextclose
remove rows with missing values (NaN) using dropna() 

dataset into two subsets: a training set and a testing set
train your model on one part of the data and evaluate its performance on another part

X represents the features or independent variable "Close" 
y represents the target variable or dependent variable "Next_Close"

test_size=0.2 indicates that you want to allocate 20% of your data to the testing set rest 80% training

generates:
X_train: The features for the training set.
X_test: The features for the testing set.
y_train: The target variable for the training set.
y_test: The target variable for the testing set.

X_train and y_train to train your machine learning model and then evaluate its performance using X_test and y_test

"Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.": random_state=42 

train_test_split randomly shuffles and splits the data set and then trains it so it is suggested to have a random state for output reproduciblity

LinearRegression is an iported class and "method" is the object of the class
