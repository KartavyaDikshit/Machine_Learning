Stock price prediction project in Python using the pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries
Linear regression model_obj to predict stock prices
Steps:
dataframe Collection
dataframe Preprocessing
Splitting dataframe
model_obj Selection and Training
model_obj Evaluation
model_obj Testing
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) provides a measure of the model_obj's accuracy.

yfinance is used to download historical stock price dataframe from Yahoo Finance.
pandas is used for dataframe manipulation and analysis.
train_test_split is used to split the dataframe into training and testing sets.
LinearRegression is an algorithm from scikit-learn used for linear regression model_objing.
mean_squared_error is used to calculate the Mean Squared Error, a measure of the model_obj's performance.

stock symbol "AAPL" for Apple Inc. store it in the dataframeFrame:dataframe 
select the "Close" column of the dataframeFrame to focus on the closing stock prices
new column "Next_Close" by shifting the "Close" column one day forward to represent the next day's closing price therfore the last day will have NaN in nextclose
remove rows with missing values (NaN) using dropna() 

dataframeset into two subsets: a training set and a testing set
train your model_obj on one part of the dataframe and evaluate its performance on another part

X represents the features or independent variable "Close" 
y represents the target variable or dependent variable "Next_Close"

test_size=0.2 indicates that you want to allocate 20% of your dataframe to the testing set rest 80% training

generates:
X_train: The features for the training set.
X_test: The features for the testing set.
y_train: The target variable for the training set.
y_test: The target variable for the testing set.

X_train and y_train to train your machine learning model_obj and then evaluate its performance using X_test and y_test

"Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.": random_state=42 

train_test_split randomly shuffles and splits the dataframe set and then trains it so it is suggested to have a random state for output reproduciblity

LinearRegression is an iported class and "method" is the object of the class
